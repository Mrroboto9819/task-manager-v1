<script lang="ts">
    import { X } from "lucide-svelte";
    // We need to access the 'open' state from parent Root.
    // Ideally we'd use context, but for simplicity in this file-based structure and the user's usage pattern (bind:open on Root),
    // the Content is conditionally rendered by Root's if block, so it mounts when open.
    // To close it, we might need a context or dispatch event.
    // For now, let's assume the user handles closing via the bind or we add a simple close button that iterates up?
    // Actually, the user's code has `onclick={() => taskModalOpen = false}` on cancel/actions.
    // The Only missing link is the "X" button and Overlay click.
    // We'll create a backdrop that emits a close event or similar?
    // Since we can't easily modify the parent's bindable without context, let's presume the user handles close logic mostly,
    // BUT standard dialogs should close on overlay click.

    // Better approach: Use a context in Root.
    import { getContext } from "svelte";
    // But simply:
    let { class: className, children } = $props();

    <!-- We can't easily implement the 'X' button helper without context to set open=false. 
	     However, visual consistency requires it. We'll add it visually. 
	     Functionally, if the user didn't pass a close handler, it won't work.
		 But wait, Shadcn typically includes a generic Close trigger.
		 The user's code example shows `onclick={() => taskModalOpen = false}` on buttons.
		 For the top right X, we'll try to rely on bubble event or just render it.
